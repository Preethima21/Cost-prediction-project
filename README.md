# Cost-prediction-project
This project aims to develop an AI-supported system for accurately predicting costs associated with implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The system will consider various cost factors such as software licenses, hardware infrastructure, customization, training, maintenance, and ongoing support. By analyzing historical data, industry benchmarks, and other relevant factors, the system will provide reliable cost predictions, enabling organizations to plan and allocate resources effectively during the ERP implementation process.

Problem Statement:

Developing an AI-supported system to predict costs accurately for implementing an ERP system is essential due to the complexities involved, including varied cost factors like software licenses, hardware infrastructure, customization, training, maintenance, and ongoing support. Organizations struggle to allocate resources effectively without reliable cost predictions, necessitating the need for a robust predictive model leveraging AI and machine learning techniques.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical data related to ERP implementations, including costs incurred for software licenses, hardware infrastructure, customization, training, maintenance, and support.

2. Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and reliability.

3. Feature Selection:Identify relevant features contributing to cost prediction, considering factors such as industry benchmarks, historical trends, and organizational specifics.

4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for cost prediction, considering factors like regression techniques, ensemble methods, and neural networks.

5. Training: Train the selected machine learning models using the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters and performance metrics to enhance prediction accuracy.

6. Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and accuracy, to assess their effectiveness in predicting costs accurately.

7. Deployment:Deploy the trained model into a production environment, integrating it into the ERP implementation process to provide real-time cost predictions and support resource allocation decisions effectively.
   
8. Data Visualization :Develop interactive dashboards and reports to enable users to explore data and make informed decisions.Incorporate visual representations such as charts, graphs, and heatmaps to facilitate data interpretation.


Results and Performance Evaluation
Cost prediction model that utilizes Linear Regression to estimate future material costs. The R-squared score achieved for the cost prediction model is 0.7871. This indicates the model's accuracy in estimating material costs based on historical sales data, delivery dates, and other relevant factors. By proactively predicting cost fluctuations, BEML can anticipate and mitigate potential financial risks.
